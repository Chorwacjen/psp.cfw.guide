::: danger
Although minimum, there is always a risk involved with installing permanent CFW. Make sure you back up your save data.

::: tip
If you haven't downloaded Infinity yet, please refer to [Page 3](/page3.md)
:::

1. Extract the Infinity zip file to a seperate folder. You will now have 2 folders, `standard` and `pspgo`.
::: danger
If you have a PSP Go, use the folder `pspgo`. Otherwise just use the `standard` folder. You might brick your PSP if you follow the wrong one.
:::
2. Copy the `EBOOT.PBP` from your chosen folder.
3. Plug in your PSP and go to `PSP\GAME` folder.
4. If `UPDATE` folder does not exist, create it. Make sure to make it all **uppercase**.
5. Paste the Infinity `EBOOT.PBP` inside the `UPDATE` folder.
6. Safely unplug your PSP.
7. Under the Game Menu in your PSP, go inside `Memory Stick` and launch Infinity.
8. Once inside Infinity, it should say "Press X for install". Press X.
9. After some processing or a blank screen, it should say "Press X to reboot". Press X again.
10. You should now be back in your PSP home menu. Go to Settings and System Information to check your version number. It should say `6.61∞`. But hold on! We are not done yet! 
11. Go back to the Infinity installer. You should see a completely different screen.
12. Press the Left button on your D-Pad and you should be taken to a screen with the list of custom firmwares.
13. When installing temporary CFW, If you have installed LME, select LME. If you have installed PRO-C, select PRO-C. You should have a * beside the one you selected. 
14. Now press the home button to return to the PSP menu.
15. Now reboot your PSP. If you don't know how to reboot, hold the power button up until the green LED turns off. Then start the PSP again.
16. Check System Information in Settings again and you should have `6.61∞`. Congratulations! You now have permanent CFW. Now you can shut off your PSP and not have to start CFW again.
