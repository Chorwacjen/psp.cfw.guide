And the speaker holes are moved up.</p><p>If you have a PSP 2000, open the battery cover and take out the battery.

Another distinguishing difference is that the bottom buttons are fully rounded instead of a semicircle.</p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/PSP-Go-FL-Open.jpg/800px-PSP-Go-FL-Open.jpg" alt="PSP Go"></p><p>This is what a PSP Go looks like.

Both come with a &quot;supposedly&quot; more stable permanent CFW solution <strong>(CIPL Flasher)</strong> for select models of the PSP.</p><p>Both CFWs are stable and matured. Both are 99.99% similar so you cannot go wrong with either of those.</p><p>These are <strong>temporary</strong> CFWs. Meaning every time you turn off your PSP, you first have to run your CFW from your Games screen before you can launch any backups or homebrew.</p><p>There is a permanent solution with a homebrew app named <strong>Infinity</strong>. This will run on top of either PRO-C2 or LME. All PSP models are supported, although you should do it at your own risk.</p><p>So in summary, there are 2 permanent CFW solutions:</p><ul><li>CIPL Flasher (Selected PSP models only)</li><li>Infinity (All PSP models)</li></ul><h2 id="information-and-warnings-about-running-cfw" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#information-and-warnings-about-running-cfw" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Information and warnings about running CFW</h2><p>In this guide, we will be permanently flashing CFW onto our systems using Infinity. Although mostly stable and there is very little chance of bricking, there is always a chance. Hard bricking a PSP is borderline impossible unless you&#39;re willingly doing it. Soft bricks can happen but are fixable on a lot of the models.</p><p>You have to start out with normally installing temporary CFW and then making it permanent. You always have a choice to not go the permanent CFW route as temporary CFW is safer than permanent.</p><h2 id="what-cfws-can-i-run" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-cfws-can-i-run" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What CFWs can I run?</h2><h3 id="temporary-cfw" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#temporary-cfw" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Temporary CFW</h3><p><strong>All PSPs can run temporary CFW the same way.</strong></p><h3 id="permanent-cfw" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#permanent-cfw" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Permanent CFW</h3><p><strong>PSP 1000</strong> Models can run permanent CFW using PRO-C2&#39;s CIPL Flasher.</p><p><strong>PSP 2000</strong> Models <strong>without date code 8C</strong> can run CFW PRO-C2 CIPL Flasher.
