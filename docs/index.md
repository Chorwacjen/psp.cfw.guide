# What is Homebrew/CFW?

[Homebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games)) is, in the most simplest terms, unsigned programs and unauthorized software that runs on systems. This usually means unlocking the full potential of a certain system that may have not been possible with a stock one. CFW means that the operating system of the console runs unsigned code itself, allowing homebrew software to run.

# Why should we Homebrew?

It gives us more possibilites on what to do with our systems. It can breathe new life into our old systems and they are still kept alive by their respective communities with the help of homebrew. It unlocks features such as emulation and online multiplayer revivals.

# What can I do with Homebrew?

- Run emulated games
- Play ISO backups
- Play community-made homebrew games
- Preserve your UMD laser from failing.

## Where can I find homebrew applications?
- [PSPunk](https://www.pspunk.com/psp-homebrew/) has a small, but curated list of homebrew
- [GameBrew](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/List_of_all_PSP_homebrew) has a lot of older homebrew, however many will only work on older firmware
- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/psp-homebrew-library) also has some titles listed, albeit you should check for legitimacy and updates

## What should I know before starting?

- On Windows, it's recommended to [show file extensions](file-extensions-windows.html) if you are using the default File Explorer
- The only bricking risk comes from installing ARK-4 permanently, whic is not required
- This guide does not overview installing ARK-4 on the Vita or the Vita CFW itself
