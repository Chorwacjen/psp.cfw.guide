# Installing emulators

The PSP can emulate mostly all systems released before the PS1. You can check out all of the emulators the PSP has in [this page by PSP-Archive](https://psp-archive.github.io/emulators/all-emulators-for-PSP.html)

### Once you have downloaded the emulators of your choice, proceed to the next step!

1. Connect your PSP to your PC
2. Copy the emulator folder with the EBOOT.PBP to `PSP\GAME`.
3. It should show up under your Memory Stick in the Game Menu.

Installing roms depends on the emulator. Make sure to read up on how you can install roms for your emulator simply by googling. Seriously, it takes like 3 minutes.

## Installing Homebrew Games

 Homebrew games come in EBOOT.PBP form. You can simply follow the steps above to install any homebrew games you like!

## Done? You have reached the end.
