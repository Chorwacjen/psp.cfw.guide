## Identifying your PSP model

A PSP 1000 has a grill at the top.

A PSP 2000 looks almost the same as a 1000, except it does not have the grill at the top. And the speaker holes are moved up.

If you have a PSP 2000, open the battery cover and take out the battery. Write down your **date code**.

The easiest way to identify a PSP 3000 is if you have a Playstation Logo button at the bottom left. Another distinguishing difference is that the bottom buttons are fully rounded instead of a semicircle.

This is what a PSP Go looks like. It does not have a UMD drive.

This is the PSP Street, which has a glassy reflective finish at the bottom. The model number is E1000.

## What CFWs are available?
Currently, there are 2 CFWs which are stable and recommended.

- LME
- PRO-C2

The main difference between both of these is that users reported that a lot of PS1 games don't work on PRO-C2. Both  come with a "supposedly" more stable permanent CFW solution **(CIPL Flasher)** for select models of the PSP.

Both CFWs are stable and matured. Both are 99.99% similar so you cannot go wrong with either of those. For the sake of this guide, we will use **LME**. But the process is same.

These are **temporary** CFWs. Meaning every time you turn off your PSP, you first have to run your CFW from your Games screen before you can launch any backups or homebrew.

There is a permanent solution with a homebrew app named **Infinity**. This will run on top of either PRO-C2 or LME. All PSP models are supported, although you should do it at your own risk.

So in summary, there are 2 permanent CFW solutions:
- CIPL Flasher (Selected PSP models only)
- Infinity (All PSP models)

## Information and warnings about running CFW
In this guide, we will be permanently flashing CFW onto our systems using Infinity. Although mostly stable and there is very little chance of bricking, there is always a chance. Hard bricking a PSP is borderline impossible unless you're willingly doing it. Soft bricks can happen but are fixable on a lot of the models.

You have to start out with normally installing temporary CFW and then making it permanent. You always have a choice to not go the permanent CFW route as temporary CFW is safer than permanent.

## What CFWs can I run?
### Temporary CFW
**All PSPs can run temporary CFW the same way.**
### Permanent CFW

**PSP 1000** Models can run permanent CFW using PRO-C2's CIPL Flasher. 

**PSP 2000** Models **without date code 8C** can run CFW PRO-C2 CIPL Flasher. Models **with date code 8C** cannot run CIPL FLasher. You have to use **Infinity**. Models without a date code at all are a bit complicated to figure out but for this guide, we will assume that models without a date code **cannot** run CIPL Flasher and have to use **Infinity**.

**PSP 3000, PSP Go! and PSP Street** Models can run permanent CFW with **Infinity**.

But remember, **ALL MODELS CAN RUN INFINITY**.
