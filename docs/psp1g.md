# Installing Permanent CFW with CIPL Flasher
### Again, DO NOT ATTEMPT this on any other PSP other than 1000 or 2000 without date code 8C

## Prerequisites
- Download [PSP Ident](https://digiex.net/attachments/pspident_075_21-10-2011-zip.13151/)
- Extract the zip and copy `PSPIDENT` to your PSP, inside `PSP>GAME` folder.
- Run PSPIDENT
- Note the `Motherboard Model`
- Check that it does **NOT** end with 88 v3.
- If it ends with 88 v3, **DO NOT FOLLOW THIS GUIDE**. Instead, go back and select **"I have a PSP 3000, Go!, Street or 2000 with date code 8C/without a date code".**
- If it does not end with 88 v3, then continue on with this guide.

0. We will assume you have installed `PRO-C` CFW, as that comes with the CIPL Flasher.
1. If not on CFW yet, boot to CFW first by clicking on `Fast Recovery`
2. After booted into CFW, click on `CIPL Flasher` from `Game Menu>Memory Stick`
3. After the text comes up, Press `X` and let it do its thing. It should automatically restart after.
4. If you are booted to the PSP menu, check `System Information` to see if `PRO-C` shows up in `System Version`.
5. If it does, congratulations! You have successfully installed permanent CFW in your PSP.
