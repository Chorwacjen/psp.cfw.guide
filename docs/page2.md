# Updating your PSP
Before doing anything, it is recommended that you are in the **latest firmware** for your PSP. At the time of writing, the latest firmware is **6.61**.

Check if you are at the latest firmware. Go to `System Settings>System Information`. Check if you are running System Software 6.61.

If you are running 6.61, proceed to the next page. If you are running anything below 6.61, keep following the guide.

### You can download firmwares below
- [6.61 for PSP 1000, 2000, 3000, Street](http://du01.psp.update.playstation.org/update/psp/image/us/2014_1212_6be8878f475ac5b1a499b95ab2f7d301/EBOOT.PBP)

## Installing the firmware.
### Prerequisites:
- You will need a **Memory Stick Pro Duo** card with enough space for games at homebrew. We recommend at least 8GB. Do note that these are proprietary memory cards and while they might look similar to SD cards, they are **NOT** SD cards. There are third party chinese adapters that convert MicroSD cards to Memory Stick Pro Duo, although reliability may vary. We recommend using an original Memory Stick Pro Duo.
- You will also need a **Mini-USB** cable. These cables are widely available and shouldn't be hard to find.

### How to update

0. (OPTIONAL) It's always best to format your memory card for good luck. Go to `System Settings>Format Memory Stick` and wait for it to finish.
1. Connect your PSP to your computer using a Mini-USB cable and go to the USB mode under Settings if not done automatically.
2. Go to `Memory Stick>PSP>GAME` and create a new folder named `UPDATE` in all capital letters.
3. Copy the `EBOOT.PBP` of the update file that you downloaded from the links above and paste it into the `UPDATE` folder.
4. Now safely disconnect the PSP from your computer.
5. Connect your charger to the PSP 
6. From your PSP, go to `Game Menu>Memory Stick` and select `PSP UPDATE`
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the firmware update.
8. After the PSP restarts and you're back in the menu, go `System Settings>System Information` and check your `System Version`. It should say 6.61.
