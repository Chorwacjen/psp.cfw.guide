## What is CFW? What does it do?
CFW means Custom Firmware. It can unlock the max potential of the system at hand. CFW is often a necessary step for older consoles because no official support is being made for them therefore the community has to pick up the torch to continue supporting the system. It can unlock various abilities such as emulating other systems, backing up and restoring important system files, allowing you to play games from your memory card, etc.

## How much memory card storage do I need?
If you want to store a lot of games, you can buy a cheap `Micro SD to Memory Stick Pro Duo Adapter` and a MicroSD card. Keep the range upto 128gb because using these adapters above that limit may pose problems.

Official Memory Stick Pro Duo can also work, though they are expensive per gigabyte. They're also more stable than the adapters.

If you have a PSP Go, you are unfortunately out of luck as these do not support Memory Stick Pro Duo format. These only support M2 Memory Cards, which are very expensive. Though progress is being made to create M2 to SD adapters. If you don't already have a memory card for the PSP Go, it is advisable for you to just buy another PSP as buying memory cards for PSP Go costs almost as much as that.

## Buying a PSP, which model should i get?
There is no single PSP model that is the best one. Each model has advantages and disadvantages. Though the commonly recommended models are PSP-2000 and PSP-3000. Either of these will be of great service.

Check out [this page on ConsoleMods Wiki](https://www.consolemods.org/wiki/PSP:PSP_Model_Differences) for information on the differences between models.

## What is the difference between LME and PRO-C2?
Nothing much. You can't go wrong with either of them. Both are stable and matured CFWs.

## What about ARK-4 CFW? Is it better than LME and PRO-C2?
Yes, it is indeed better. It has useful safety features against soft bricks, better compatibility with PSP games, custom launcher instead of the PSP menu (arguably better looking launcher), support for more models to get permanent CFW using the new CIPL Flasher, etc. This is clearly the final hurrah for the PSP and will be the way forward in the future. 

But for now, it needs to mature and be more stable. It is still very new and has a lot of features incoming so it will be required to frequently update. That means new bugs and glitches that will likely mess with your PSP. When it is stable enough, we will make a seperate guide for ARK-4.

And remember that LME and PRO-C2 has been on the scene for more than 10 years and can do everything an average person needs when hacking the PSP.

## Help! I pressed the Select button on the PSP Menu and there is this weird screen! 
That, my friend, is the VSH menu. It is useful for debugging the PSP. It's best not to mess with it if you dont know what you're doing. You can simply press Select again to make it go away.

## How do I add roms to emulators?
Different emulators ask for different rom locations. Make sure you read the instructions from the emulator's original place.
But most emulators will let you select the directory your roms are.
Suggestion: Make a directory inside `PSP\GAME` called `ROMS` and then create folders like `gb` (gameboy), `gba` (gameboy advance), `sms` (sega master system), `gen` (sega genesis), etc. Creating the folders in short-form like this helps differentiate it better without problems. This is how you would stay organized.

## I do not want CFW anymore, how will I remove it?
If you have installed temporary CFW, you don't actually need to do anything. Just reboot your PSP and don't run the CFW launcher.

If you have installed permanent CFW like Infinity or CIPL Flasher, the process is a bit more complicated. We will release a guide soon about this.

## Is hacking my PSP safe? 
It is indeed safe **IF** you follow the instructions exactly how it is given. Even with the safest methods in any system, you still have a chance of bricking if you do not follow the guide for it perfectly. 

The most common causes of bricking are:
- Installing the wrong CFW version. Like installing 6.60 PRO-C2 on your 6.61 firmware PSP. Or installing `pspgo` version of Infinity on your PSP-3000.
- Low charge when performing the hacking process. Always make sure to plug in your PSP before doing the flash. If you live in an area with frequent electricity shortages, make sure to plug the PSP charging adapter onto an UPS.
- Taking out the battery during the installation process. Make sure the battery cover is sealed tight and there's no leeway for the battery to come out during the installation.
- Purposefully shutting down the PSP during the installation.

TLDR: Just don't be stupid. Follow the instructions properly and your PSP will be safe.

## How do I check if CFW is running?
Simply go to `Settings > System Information` and check the version. If it just says `6.61` or whatever firmware version you're on, then CFW is not running. If it says `6.61 PRO-C2` or `6.61 (insert CFW name here)`, that means CFW is running.
