# Installing temporary CFW
### PRO-C2
1. Extract the downloaded files onto a folder. You should have 2 folders named `PSP` and `seplugins`. Copy these.
2. Connect your PSP to your computer and turn on USB mode if not done automantically.
3. Go inside your Memory Stick and paste these folders. (If asked to merge or replace, click merge or replace)
4. Disconnect your PSP from the computer and connect it to the charger (optional but ensures that your PSP does not die during the CFW process, otherwise it may brick.)
5. Go to `Game menu>Memory Stick` and click on `PRO-C Updater`. After a while, it should come to a screen with text and a few options.
6. Click `X` button on your PSP and it should show `Writing flash0...` messages. 
7. Press `X` again when prompted and it should launch you back to the PSP menu.
8. Once back in the menu, go to `System Settings>System Information` and it should say "6.61 PRO-C".
9. Congratulations! You have installed temporary CFW.
10. Note that whenever you **reboot** your PSP, meaning when you start your PSP and the intro "Sony Computer Entertainment" comes up, you **must** go to `Game Menu>Memory Stick` and click on `PRO-C Fast Recovery` in order to get CFW working again.

### Now you could stop here.
Temporary CFW by itself works perfectly fine. It's not limiting at all. So you have the option to stop here and continue installing Homebrew and games.
